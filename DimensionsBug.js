This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially when the app is launched or rotated.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` initially, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This often happens because the dimensions aren't immediately available when the component mounts.
